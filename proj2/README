PHASE1:
  To create the LKM and test file, simply navigate to code directory in /proj2/open_close_intercept/ 
  In terminal run the command "make" which should create the LKM and user-land test code object file named "test"
  Next, insert the Kernel Module by running "sudo insmod open_close_intercept.ko" and enter root password
  In terminal run ./test followed by "tail -n X /var/log/syslog" where X is an arbitrary integer 
   specifying how many lines of log to print
  The logs should show UID and files that have been opened and closed alongside a call to ref_sys_cs3013_syscall1 
   that gets intercepted.
  
PHASE2:
  To create the LKM and test file, simply navigate to code directory in /proj2/process_info/ 
  In terminal run the command "make" which should create the LKM and user-land test code object file named "test"
  Next, insert the Kernel Module by running "sudo insmod process_info_module.ko" and enter root password
  Run the test user-land code by running "./test"
  The test code waits 2 seconds before printing so that the children tasks have time to run through a for-loop
    and log some CPU time. 
  All results should be printed in terminal as opposed to logs. 

CLEANING:
  For both phases, simply type "make clean" in either of the two directories to remove compiled object and LKM files
  To remove Phase 1 LKM run "sudo rmmod open_close_intercept.ko" and enter root password
  To remove Phase 2 LKM run "sudo rmmod process_info_module.ko" and enter root password
